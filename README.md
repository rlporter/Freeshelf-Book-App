During this project, you will build a Ruby on Rails application to collect an index of free programming books online. This application will, after three days, allow users to:

1) look at the index (show),DONE
2) add new books (create),DONE
3) edit books they added (update),
4) and remove books (destroy).

DAY ONE TODOs:
On the first day, your application should:

1)Allow anyone to create a new book entry

**Books have, at a minimum, a title, author, description, and URL**
2)Allow anyone to update or delete a book entry
3)Allow anyone to view the list of books


Added features  

If you finish all of the above, consider some of the following:

Style your application with your own CSS by editing app/assets/stylesheets/application.css or digging into the asset pipeline
Paginate the list of books with Kaminari
